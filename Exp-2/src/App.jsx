import Home from './pages/Home';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Home />
    </div>
  );
I don't see a button in the code you've shared. The `App.jsx` file only renders the `<Home />` component.

To help you debug why the button isn't visible, I need to see:

1. The `Home` component code (in `/src/pages/Home.jsx`)
2. Any CSS files that might be hiding the button
}
3. Browser console errors
closing brace and semicolon are missing

Could you share the `Home` component code? That's likely where the button is defined.
